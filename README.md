## üß† Assumptions & Design Decisions

- All files are uploaded to the root directory of the user‚Äôs Google Drive.
- OAuth tokens are held in memory for simplicity (no DB/session persistence).
- Minimal frontend using Bootstrap 5 and EJS for clarity and speed.
- No folder creation, renaming, or sharing features included (per task scope).
